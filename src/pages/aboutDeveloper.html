    <p>I am the junior developer who's been given the opportunity to work with you on this project, and to tell you a little about myself ...</p>
    <p>I live in Gothenburg, where I am also a astudent at Teknikhögskolan. At Teknikhögskolan I am enrolled in a two year long programme to become a .NET/fullstack-developer.<br>We are now on our second term and have just about finished our third course, Webdevelopment frontend. This course is where I got involved with this project.</p>
    <p>My work experience before this programme is mostly within the web-development world, but I also have a little bit of experience with desktop development and open source projects.</p>
    <p>Between early 2011 and late 2016 <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?user_id=406294">I contributed to Mozilla's open source projects</a>, mainly the webbrowser Mozilla Firefox, and I have continued to contribute a sporadically since.</p>
    <p>I have enjoyed working on this project, it has been a great learning experience, and I look foward to working further with on this project in the near future.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Best regards,</p>
    <p>/ Johan Charlez</p>
